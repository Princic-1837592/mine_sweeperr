//! # Mine sweeper
//!
//! An easy-to-use interface to manage the backend of a mine sweeper game.
//!
//! Import [`MineSweeper`](MineSweeper) and one of its implementations
//! - [`MSMatrix`](MSMatrix) (recommended)
//! - [`MSHash`](MSHash)
//!
//! to use it.
//! ```
//! use mine_sweeperr::{MSMatrix, MineSweeper, Difficulty, solver::NonDeterministic};
//!
//! // Create a new game with a 16x16 board and 40 mines
//! // setting the starting point at (0, 0)
//! let mut ms: MSMatrix = MSMatrix::new::<NonDeterministic>(Difficulty::medium(), (0, 0)).unwrap();
//!
//! // Reveal the cell at (0, 0)
//! ms.open((0, 0)).unwrap();
//! ```
//! You can also create your own implementation, if you prefer:
//! this crate already declares the needed functions and types to create and manage a mine sweeper game.
//!
//! Read the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Princic-1837592/mine_sweeperr/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for information about the latest changes.
//!
//! <span style="color:red">**IMPORTANT**</span>:
//! This crate supports [wasm](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-bindgen) but, in that case,
//! seeded random generators (or in general the rand crate) are not allowed
//! due to incompatibility with wasm itself.
//! Maybe in future versions some kind of trick will be implemented to make it work.
//! A [working implementation](https://princic-1837592.github.io/mine_sweeper/index.html) of this library with wasm frontend
//! is available on [my GitHub page](https://Princic-1837592.github.io)
